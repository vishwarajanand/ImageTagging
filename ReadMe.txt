# Image tagging with MobileNet and p5.js

This page loads images from third party websites. So, in order to allow them do so, you might need to install chrome extensions to allow CORS requests. One such extension is [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)


# Demo
Hosted [here](https://vishwarajanand.github.io/ImageTagging/), keep refreshing to see new tags.

# Extend
Add new image urls in `sketch.js` to see new tags.
