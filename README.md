# Image tagging with MobileNet and p5.js

This page loads images from third party websites. So, in order to allow them do so, you might need to install chrome extensions to allow CORS requests. One such extension is [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)

## Demo for single image tagging

Hosted here: [https://vishwarajanand.github.io/ImageTagging/](https://vishwarajanand.github.io/ImageTagging/), keep refreshing to see new tags.

## Demo for multi image tagging

1. Clone this repo.
2. `cd npm_proj`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

## Extend

Add new image urls in `sketch.js`/`npm_proj/data.js` to see new tags.
